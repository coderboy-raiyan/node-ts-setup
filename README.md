# 🧰 Simple TypeScript Starter | 2023

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript**, particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Linting with Eslint and Prettier
- Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- VS Code debugger scripts
- Local development with ts-node-dev

### Scripts

Starts the application in development using `ts-node-dev` to do hot reloading.

#### `yarn dev`

###

If you want to use it just do these steps

- First clone the repo.
- now you need to add your github origin by using this command
  `git remote set-url origin https://git-repo/new-repository.git`
- then push it to your github
- And now you are ready to use it 🚀👍
